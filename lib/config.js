    // previous vendor's key and sent it, in exchange for "check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" about a variable
    // that was perfectly correct. **An error pointing the wrong way costs more time than no error.**
    //
    // **What belongs here is measured, not asserted: read by more than one vendor, with a different
    // correct value for each.** Only these three qualify. `maxTokens` / `effort` / `chunkSize` and
    // the like are cross-vendor budgets (the same value is right everywhere) and stay at the outer
    // level; `webFetch` / `searchTool` / `anthropicExtras` are read by exactly one vendor, so a
    // leftover value is ignored rather than misapplied, and they stay outer too.

    // necessarily hold that vendor's values, so falling back to them for that vendor is correct;
    // for any other vendor there is **no fallback** — that is the bug described above.
    // A new config only needs `providers`; these two fields remain so that an old config needs no edits

    // vendor being asked for**, and they override both places in the file
    apiKey: '',
    // **Left empty by default so each vendor uses its own default model.** No concrete name can go
    // here: model names are vendor-specific (claude-* / deepseek-*), and putting an Anthropic name
    // here guarantees that anyone switching provider without also editing model hits "the provider
    // and the model disagree".

    // **It must be sent separately from `thinking`.** Bundled onto `anthropicExtras` it is a dead
    // control: that switch is always false when baseUrl is set, and the `provider: "deepseek"`
    // preset always sets baseUrl.
    //
    // Measured (DeepSeek /anthropic, the same 10-achievement shard, with web tools):
    //
    //   nothing sent  337 s  8 searches  255 chars/achievement   ← what ran while it could not be sent
    //   high          (not measured separately; the previous default on the official endpoint)
    //   medium        219 s  6 searches  275 chars/achievement
    //   low            43 s  2 searches  211 chars/achievement
    //
    // **Thinking volume, search count and characters per achievement all move together** — this is
    // one control, not three.
    // The research depth given up by lowering it is visible: `searchQueries` is printed on both the
    // CLI and the Dashboard on every generation ("can search ≠ did search"). So this is not a silent
    // degradation but a trade-off with numbers the user can read.
    //
    // **Do not trust the absolute figures.** The same 10 achievements with nothing sent took
    // 76 / 174 / 337 seconds across three runs — more variance than there is between the tiers. What
    // is trustworthy is a **ratio** measured back to back within one batch.
    //
    // Whether it is sent depends on whether the endpoint accepts it, per the measured table in
    // ai-anthropic.js; anything not in that table is sent nothing.
    effort: 'high',
    // The thinking field: 'adaptive' | 'disabled' | 'off' (send nothing). adaptive is sent by
    // default only on the official endpoint.
    //
    // **'disabled' is absurdly fast (6 s against 337 s) and turns off web search along with it** —
    // measured twice at 0 searches, i.e. the model writes the guide from memory, which is exactly
    // what the canSearch admission design guards against.
    // It stays here so it can be configured, not as "a faster high". For speed, adjust effort.
    //
    // And **never rely on budget_tokens**: DeepSeek's /anthropic accepts it, returns 200, and then
    // moves in the opposite direction (asking for 2000 produced 49,653 characters of thinking and
    // asking for 8000 produced 62,107, both more than sending nothing).
    // So buildBody never sends it
    thinking: null,
    // The **combined** ceiling for thinking plus prose, not a prose ceiling. Too low and the writing
    // is truncated partway, and a truncated guide is worse than a failed generation (the validator
    // cannot detect that the second half was never written)
    maxTokens: 32000,

    // how much it costs, not what is technically writable** — anything over one shard's worth is
    // written in shards automatically (chunkDefs in guidegen.js).
    // The largest game in the library has 408 achievements, so 500 leaves some headroom
    maxAchievements: 500,
    // The **maximum** number of achievements per shard. The reason for sharding is not that the list
    // does not fit (the list is small) but that **the prose does not**: an achievement's three-part
    // entry is around 150 characters, so 400 of them is 60,000 characters, past every vendor's
    // single-response ceiling. And exceeding it raises no error — the validator merely reports that
    // every achievement in the second half is missing a checkbox
    //
    // A ceiling, not a fixed length: the program computes the shard count from this number and then
    // **spreads** the achievements evenly across them (55 achievements at 50 is 28+27, not 50+5). So
    // lowering it lowers the ceiling on one shard's prose, and the shard count only rises as needed.
    // See chunkDefs in guidegen.js
    chunkSize: 50,
    // How many feedback rewrite rounds at most when validation fails. Still failing, it is kept as a
    // draft with a report of which entries failed — discarding burns the money and the time and
    // leaves nothing, while "which entry failed" carries information
    maxRounds: 3,
    // **How many shards the first round writes concurrently.** The shards' contents are disjoint
    // with no ordering dependency — they could only queue because the whole guide shared one session
    // (one session is one chain). With a chain per shard, a four-shard game's first round goes from
    // "the sum of the shards" to "the slowest shard".
    //
    // First round only. Later rounds are targeted re-asks, usually of one or two shards, and a shard
    // that was split shares its parent's session — concurrency would have two requests writing one
    // messages array. Small gain, dirty failure mode, so those rounds stay sequential (see the
    // comment in guidegen.js).
    //
    // 3 is conservative. Raising it mainly consumes the vendor's rate-limit allowance, and hitting a
    // 429 takes the maxRetries backoff path rather than losing a shard. Setting 1 returns entirely to
    // the old sequential behaviour, which is useful when diagnosing
    concurrency: 3,
    // **How many searches at most within one request.** This is the primary constraint on guide
    // depth: measured, 6 searches across 51 achievements (one search per 8.5 achievements) produced
    // notes of a few dozen characters each, with the hard achievements not covered at all.
    // Guide generation is a case where more searching is worth more than less — one search is far
    // cheaper than a paragraph of invention
    //
    // **Do not add a monetary ceiling here.** Vendor rates change, we cannot verify them, and how
    // the search tool bills has never been measured — any "ceiling" would rest on an amount we do
    // not believe ourselves, handing the user controls they have no basis for setting and merely

    maxFetchTokens: 50000,
    // Non-empty = **hard-restrict** search to these domains. Empty by default: how well Chinese
