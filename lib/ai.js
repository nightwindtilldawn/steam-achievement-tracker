/**
 * The AI provider layer — the shared half
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Each vendor's differences are confined to its own file (`ai-anthropic.js` / `ai-deepseek.js`);
 * this holds what they share: usage accounting, pricing, sessions, SSE unpacking, and the verdict
 * on whether a round's result is usable.
 *
 * Adding a third vendor means writing one new file, implementing the interface below, and
 * registering it in `createProvider`. Neither this file nor `guidegen.js` should change for it.
 *
 * ## The provider interface
 *
 * ```
 * name                                 the provider's identifier
 * model                                the current model name
 * canSearch                            **whether it has server-side web search**. See below
 * webTools()                           this vendor's own web tool declarations (the shapes all differ)
 * buildBody({system, messages, tools}) assemble the request body; --dry prints it without sending
 * send({system, messages, tools, onEvent, signal}) → {
 *   content        this vendor's native message content, stored back into the session verbatim and resent
 *   text           the extracted plain-text prose
 *   stopReason     **the unified vocabulary**, see below
 *   rawStopReason  this vendor's own value, for diagnosis only
 *   usage / model / continuations / searchQueries
 *   toolErrors     `[{tool, errorCode}]`. `tool` is **also unified vocabulary**: `search` / `fetch`,
 *                  never leaking a vendor's block names — because the two differ in severity, see `checkResult`
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `signal` is optional and comes from the caller (guidegen.js's Cancel button plumbing); a
 * provider that receives one must abort the in-flight request when it fires and reject with an
 * `AiError` carrying `cancelled: true`, distinct from its own idle-timeout error — see `#once` in
 * any of the three provider files for the combined-signal shape.
 *
 * ## The unified stopReason vocabulary
 *
 * The vendors phrase it differently (Anthropic uses `end_turn`/`max_tokens`/`refusal`, the
 * OpenAI-compatible endpoints use `stop`/`length`/`content_filter`), and it is **translated to one
 * set at the provider boundary** so that `checkResult` and `guidegen` are not littered with "if it
 * is this vendor then…".
 *
 * - `end_turn`   finished normally
 * - `max_tokens` truncated. **Prose exists but only half of it**, the most dangerous kind
 * - `refusal`    refused by a safety policy
 * - `recitation` blocked for reproducing copyrighted content at length (no current vendor produces
 *   this; the slot is kept for one that does)
 * - `other`      unrecognised. The raw value is in `rawStopReason`; nothing is guessed
 *
 * ## canSearch
 *
 * The design document makes "has server-side search" a hard admission requirement, on the grounds
 * that letting one without search in makes quality depend on which vendor the user picked, and the
 * user cannot see that difference. So this cannot rest on someone remembering it; it has to be a
 * property the provider declares and the layers above can read:
 *
 * - `guide-gen` **refuses to generate by default** for a provider with `canSearch === false`,
 *   requiring an explicit `--no-research`
 * - The prompt switches to the "you have no web access, write nothing you are unsure of" variant
 * - The result states plainly that this guide involved no research
 *
 * So "no web access this time" is unmissable, rather than a quality difference the user cannot see.
