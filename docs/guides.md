# Guide checkbox sync

Optional feature. If you keep achievement guides as checklists, `checkbox-sync` ticks off the boxes for achievements you've actually unlocked on Steam.

Guide *content* stays wherever you write it — the database only stores a pointer to it. Two backends are supported, and each game uses exactly one.

## Notion

A guide is any page whose body starts with a line like `appid: 3117820`. That's how a page gets matched to a game.

Those pages live in a Notion **database**, not a plain page. The tool reads it with `GET /databases/{id}` and `POST /databases/{id}/query`, so handing it a page ID — or a view ID, or a pasted URL — fails with a 404 that looks exactly like a permissions problem.

**One-time setup** — there is an illustrated Chinese walkthrough in [notion-setup.md](notion-setup.md), written for someone doing this from the app's settings page rather than the CLI. The short version:

1. At the [developer portal](https://app.notion.com/developers/connections), press **New connection**, then copy the **Access token** from its **Configuration** tab (`ntn_…`). Those labels are quoted verbatim on purpose — an instruction phrased in concept names ("Internal Integration") sends people looking for words that are not on the screen. Notion has renamed these more than once (it used to be **New integration** / **Internal Integration Secret** at `notion.so/my-integrations`); go by what your screen says, since the program accepts any of them.
2. In Notion, open the page that will hold your guides → `•••` → **连接 / Connections** → select it. Child pages and databases inherit it. Without this every call returns 404.
3. Run `node tracker.js init --notion --create`. It prompts for the secret (not echoed), lists the pages your connection can see, and builds a guide database under the one you pick — properties and status options already correct. The database ID is saved for you, so you never copy one by hand.

Already have a database you want to use? Run `node tracker.js init --notion` instead and paste its ID: open the database as a full page and take the 32-character hex string from the URL, the part *before* `?v=` (that part is the view ID, not the database).

In the packaged app, step 3 is the **第 3 步 · Notion 攻略同步** section of the setup page — reachable on first run, and afterwards from the **设置** button on the Dashboard. It has the same **新建一个攻略数据库** flow, and the same manual field if you already have a database. Leaving the secret blank there keeps whatever is already saved rather than clearing it.

### What the database needs

| | |
|---|---|
| Title property | Any `title` property. The name doesn't matter — it's read, never assumed. |
| Status property | **Optional.** If present it needs the options `Not started`, `In progress`, `Staged`, `Done`. |
| Everything else | Ignored. Extra properties and extra status options are harmless. |

Those four are exactly the values the program ever writes: `Not started` / `In progress` / `Done` when a page is created (chosen from real progress), and `Done` / `Staged` when the status convergence runs. Validation only asks whether the value *being written* is one of the options, so anything extra you keep for your own workflow is untouched. Three of the four are Notion's own defaults for a status property, so a hand-made one usually only needs `Staged` adding.

A database with **no** status property at all is legal — guides are created, discovered and ticked normally, and only the `Status` convergence has nothing to write.

An auto-created database leaves all four options in the `To-do` group, because **Notion's API silently ignores status groups**: passing them at creation and PATCHing them afterwards both return HTTP 200 and change nothing. It affects no behaviour (only `options` is ever read) — drag them into the right groups by hand if the board view bothers you.

**Then check it:**

```bash
node tracker.js notion-check      # token, database, title property, status options, page count
node tracker.js notion-check --fix          # try to append the missing status options
node tracker.js notion-check --probe-write  # create a page and archive it: proves write access
node tracker.js guides --notion   # finds pages not yet registered and links them up
```

`notion-check` exists because every failure on this path looks like every other one: a bad token, an ID that isn't a database, a database that was never shared, a status option that's missing.

**The setup page runs the same check when you connect a database**, so you do not have to know this command exists to find out your database is unusable. Pasting an ID validates the whole schema, not just that the ID resolves; anything wrong is reported there and then, with a 帮我补上 or 套用 button when it is the kind of problem the program can fix. It also creates one page and immediately archives it — that is the only way to tell a read-only connection from a working one, and a read-only token otherwise passes every check and fails at the first `guide-gen`.

Appending options writes to your database, so it only ever happens from a button or `--fix`, never silently on save. Existing options are carried over untouched; nothing is renamed or removed. Measured against the live API: a status property missing `Staged` has it added, and the existing options keep their colours. Whether it worked is still decided by reading the database back afterwards rather than by the API's response code, because Notion accepts *some* status-property edits with a 200 and changes nothing (option *groups* behave that way), and a repair that lies about succeeding is worse than one that admits it cannot. If that ever happens you get told exactly which options to add by hand.

Pages without an `appid:` line are skipped quietly every run — they're guides you haven't written yet, not errors.

## Local markdown

A `.md` file in `guides/` with the same `appid: NNNNNN` line near the top. No token, no setup:

```bash
node tracker.js guides --local
```

Checkboxes are ordinary markdown — `- [ ]` becomes `- [x]`, in place, with the rest of the line untouched. Since these are files in the repo, `git diff` shows you exactly what changed and `git checkout guides/` undoes it.

If a game already has a Notion guide registered, a same-appid local `.md` is left alone unless you pass `--force`. One appid, one backend.

### Moving a local guide into Notion

Either the **⬆ Notion** button on that game's row in the Dashboard, or:

```bash
node tracker.js guide-to-notion <appid> --dry-run   # shows exactly what would happen, writes nothing
node tracker.js guide-to-notion <appid>
```

Headings, checkboxes (including nested sub-steps and their ticked state), plain bullets and markdown tables all carry over as real Notion blocks. Anything Notion can't represent — `<details>`, third-level headings — becomes a plain paragraph, and the dry run lists those lines before you commit to it.

**Your ticks come across untouched.** Migration never re-derives checked state from Steam; that's `checkbox-sync`'s job, and quietly doing it here would mean a move could change your data.

New pages get their `Status` the same way as generated ones — `Done` / `In progress` / `Not started` by real progress. 

Afterwards the page is **read back and compared line by line** against the file — same count, same text, same ticks. Only if that matches does the local file move to `guides/.migrated/`. If anything is off, the migration fails, says which line, and **your file stays exactly where it was**. Nothing is ever deleted.

Two refusals, same as for generated guides: a page with that game's title that already has content, and two pages sharing the title.

This is not a quality check. Your guide is your guide — it is moved as written, not graded on the way through.

### Having one written for you

**Hiding spoilers is asked each time, not configured.** The confirmation dialog carries a **Spoiler guard** (「防剧透」) switch beside the treatment, off by default. Turn it on and the program asks, once the guide is written, which sentences give the story away, and moves those into a fold you click to open — endings, twists, who somebody turns out to be, and what a hidden achievement actually asks of you, since Steam publishes no description for those and your guide is the only place that condition appears.

Turning it on costs one more call to the AI, which the dialog says beside the switch; that is why it is a choice at the moment you confirm the spend rather than a setting in a file. It is off by default because a guide is usually written for a game you have already finished, where there is nothing left to spoil. On the command line it is `--spoiler`; the same choice applies to **Rewrite** (「重写」) and to a partial rewrite, and on a partial rewrite only the entries you named are looked at.

**What it does not promise:** whether a folded sentence really spoils anything, and whether an unfolded one should have been folded, are judgements no checker can make. It also only looks at achievement entries, not at a section's introductory prose.

`node tracker.js guide-gen <appid>` has an AI research the game online and write the guide, then validates the result against your actual achievement data and registers it. Set it up once:

```bash
node tracker.js init --ai
```

That asks which provider, takes your key without echoing it, and **verifies it with a real request** before writing anything — so an invalid key, a retired model name or a tier with no quota surfaces there rather than halfway through generating a guide. Then:

```bash
node tracker.js ai-check              # confirms search actually works
node tracker.js guide-gen <appid>     # asks once before it starts
node tracker.js guide-gen <appid> --effort low   # faster, less research
```

`--effort` (`low` / `medium` / `high`, default `high`) sets how much research goes into
this one guide; the Dashboard offers two of them (极速 = `low`, 深度 = `high`) in the
confirmation before each run — `medium` measured indistinguishable from `high`, so it
stays accepted in config and on the CLI but is not put on screen.
Lower settings do not write worse solutions for the hard achievements — they stop
researching the easy middle of the list, which then gets filled with lines that could have
been written without looking anything up. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md#notes-on-individual-options) for the measurements.

If a guide is already registered for that appid, `guide-gen` refuses — regenerating over
one is a separate, explicit action:

```bash
node tracker.js guide-gen <appid> --overwrite
```

That backs the old guide up first (a local `.md` is copied, a Notion page is dumped as raw
block JSON, both into `guides/.backups/`) and shows you what you are about to replace
**before** it writes anything: how big the current guide is, how many achievements it
covers, and which boxes you ticked by hand will not survive. Achievement checkboxes are
re-ticked from your Steam data automatically, so their state comes back exactly; boxes for
sub-steps match no achievement, so those come back unticked. If the backup fails, nothing
is written. Add `--dry-run` to see all of that and stop there.

To get one of those backups back, see [Guide archive](#guide-archive) below.

The Dashboard offers the same thing: a game that already has a guide shows a **♻ 重写** button
next to its 📖 攻略 link, and it runs the same preflight before anything is written.

That dialog also carries the partial rewrite, and its **范围** row is a plain either/or: **整篇**
(the default) or **自选**. Choosing 自选 reveals a **重写要求** field — the same thing `--note` passes
on the command line, where blank simply means "research these again and rewrite them". The dialog
holds one width throughout, so nothing shifts under the cursor as you tick.

**It has no body text at all.** Scope, count and instruction are each written on the control that
carries them, and a sentence above them would only restate something already on screen —
including the loss note, which "rewrite" already implies and the backup already covers. That note is still printed in full on the command line: `--overwrite`
writes for someone who typed a flag and can afford the detail, a dialog cannot, and one wording
forced to serve both is wrong in both places.

Above the list sit two **filters** — `稀有` and `未解锁`. Pressing one narrows what the list shows;
pressing both shows the intersection. **They change what you see and never touch what you have
selected**, which is what makes their pressed state honest: it means "I pressed this", nothing else.
`全选`, next to the count, takes everything currently shown, and `清空` is the way back.

That split — filter to look, then take — is the third arrangement of this row, and each move was
forced by using it:

| Was | Broke because |
|---|---|
| Scope options next to 整篇 | You were confirming a paid, irreversible rewrite over a set you had never seen and could not adjust |
| Toggles that selected a batch | The batches overlap (a locked achievement can also be rare), so pressing one lit or dimmed another — the lit state was a *derived fact* the user read as "I pressed this" |
| One-shot buttons that added a batch | Add-only can express unions and nothing else. "The rare ones I haven't got yet" — the most useful set there is — could only be reached by taking all 22 rare and unticking by hand |

Two filters give every combination the old rows could not: rare, locked, both, or neither.

**自选** opens the guide's own achievements, grouped by the section headings they sit under, each
row showing its global unlock rate and whether you have it. Every section heading carries its own
**tri-state checkbox** — click it to take or drop the whole section — so picking a section and
picking individual entries are the same control, which is why the dialog has no separate `section:`
option. (That behaviour existed one round earlier as "click the heading", explained in a sentence
that only appeared while nothing was selected; nobody found it. An affordance you have to read
about is not an affordance.) The heading itself **collapses** its section, so a long guide can be
reduced to a list of section names rather than scrolled end to end; filtering shows matches whether
or not their section is collapsed, and restores the collapsed state when you clear it. There is a filter box, the
confirm button stays disabled until something is selected, and what gets sent is a plain list of
the selected achievements.

**Section grouping works on Notion guides too.** `fetchAllToDoBlocks` only collects checkboxes,
so it cannot see headings — but the dialog reads the page with `fetchAllBlocks`, which returns
every block including headings. (`--only section:` on the command line is still local-only; it
receives the markdown text rather than the blocks.) If the outline can't be read for any reason,
the list falls back to a flat one rather than failing.

#### Rewriting only part of a guide

`--overwrite` replaces the whole guide. `--only` replaces just the entries you name, and **every
other byte of the guide stays exactly as it was** — other achievements, section headings, `<details>`
blocks, tables, and any passage you edited by hand.

```bash
node tracker.js guide-gen <appid> --only rare --note "写清楚前置条件和易错过的地方"
node tracker.js guide-gen <appid> --only "第三步,收集狂" --note "改成表格"
node tracker.js guide-gen <appid> --only locked --dry-run
```

`--only` takes one of these:

| Selector | Picks |
|---|---|
| `rare` / `rare:25` | Achievements below 10% global unlock rate (or the percentage you give). Not merely the same number as the prompt's 🟠 tier — `rarityTag` imports the constant, so the entries the prompt calls 偏难 and the entries `rare` picks cannot drift apart |
| `locked` | Ones you haven't earned yet |
| `section:主线` | Everything under that heading. **Command line only** — see the Dashboard section below for picking by section on a Notion guide |
| `名字A,名字B` | Named achievements, by Chinese name, English name, or `api_name` |

That list is deliberately the same set the Dashboard dialog offers, and three plausible selectors
are deliberately absent — `all` (whole-guide rewrite has its own flag, `--overwrite`), `thin` (its
criterion needs its threshold explained before it means anything, which makes it unusable as a button),
`unlocked` (rewriting entries you have already earned was never something anyone asked for) and
`failing` (in practice that set is almost always empty, and a button permanently reading `0` just
makes you work out what the `0` means every time — `guide-lint <appid>` lists those properly).
If a selector cannot be drawn as a button, that is a signal about the selector.

`--note "…"` is the instruction, passed to the model as written. Without it the entries are simply
rewritten from fresh research. The model always *sees* the existing entry, which is what makes
"写详细点" mean anything.

**Run `--dry-run` first.** It prints the entries the selector picked and the exact request that would
be sent, and spends nothing. A selector that matched the wrong entries is the one mistake here that
costs money to discover.

Three things are worth knowing about how this stays safe:

- **Only the entries that were asked for are ever written back.** The guarantee comes from the
  program splicing named entries at line numbers (local) or block ids (Notion) it recorded up front —
  not from instructing the model to leave the rest alone. If the model returns an achievement that
  wasn't named, it is reported and **discarded**.
- **Problems the guide already had don't block the change.** A guide can fail validation for reasons
  outside what you asked to fix — hand-written guides often do. Those are listed and stepped over;
  only problems inside the entries being rewritten, or ones that appeared as a result of the change,
  hold it back. Nothing is written until they clear.
- **Hand-ticked sub-step boxes survive outside the scope.** They are the one thing a full rewrite
  destroys, and `--only` loses them only under the entries it actually replaces. The confirmation
  says how many are at risk and how many are being kept.

On Notion the touched checkboxes are **edited in place** rather than the page being cleared and
rewritten, so block ids survive — links you saved to a specific entry still work, and anything the
markdown converter can't represent is never at risk. The page is read back and re-validated
afterwards, same as a full generation.

Achievements the guide has no checkbox for cannot be targeted this way — there is nothing to
replace. Those are reported separately and need a full `--overwrite` (or a line written by hand).

A guide that fails validation three times is left in `guides/.drafts/` rather than thrown away —
you paid for it, and *which* checks failed is itself information. Nothing scans that directory, so
leftovers are harmless, but they do accumulate. To see and clear them:

```bash
node tracker.js drafts               # list only, never deletes
node tracker.js drafts --clean       # delete them
```

`--older-than N` limits `--clean` to drafts older than N days, so today's failure survives a sweep.

Two providers work. Both do server-side web search, which is what the research step needs.

| `ai.provider` | Where the key comes from |
|---|---|
| `deepseek` | [platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) |
| `anthropic` | [platform.claude.com/settings/keys](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys) |

Pricing and rate limits are the vendors' to state and change, so they aren't reproduced here. `ai-check --models` asks your key which models it can actually use, and `ai-check` confirms search is working before you spend a run on it.

`--dry-run` shows you the assembled prompt and where the guide would land without sending anything.

#### Where the finished guide goes

**If Notion is configured, into Notion** — a new page in your guide database, next to the ones you wrote by hand. Splitting your notes across two places just because one of them was machine-written is the wrong default. Pass `--local` for a `guides/*.md` file instead; with no Notion token, local is all there is.

Two cases get refused rather than guessed at, because both would damage notes you can't get back:

- **A page with that game's title already exists and has content in it.** Very likely something you wrote. It says so and stops; clear the page yourself if you really want it regenerated.
- **Two pages share that title.** It won't pick one.

An existing page that is *empty* is treated as the page you meant — those "created the page, haven't written the guide yet" placeholders get filled in, and its title, icon and status are left exactly as you set them.

New pages get the Steam icon and a `Status` derived from where you actually are in the game: **`Done`** at 100%, **`In progress`** with some achievements unlocked, **`Not started`** with none. Nothing later revisits a page that isn't at 100%, so the value written at creation is the one that sticks — which is why it's computed rather than fixed. Notion's block format can't carry everything markdown can (`<details>`, tables, third-level headings); anything it can't represent is written as a plain paragraph — **the text is never dropped** — and the affected lines are listed when it finishes.

After writing, the page is **read back and re-validated with the same linter**, because a Notion write returns 200 whether or not the content came out the way you meant.

The checkboxes are **not** written by the model. It only ever emits `- [ ]`; the ticks are applied afterwards from your real unlock data, which makes "checked state equals real unlock state" impossible to get wrong rather than merely checkable. The `# 游戏名` and `appid:` header lines are written by the program too — a mis-transcribed appid would file the guide under a different game. (On a Notion page the title comes from the page property, so only the `appid:` line goes into the body.)

What the machine checks is **format and data**: every achievement has its own checkbox row, no merged rows, names match Steam exactly, descriptions are quoted verbatim, ticks match reality. If that fails it feeds the specific errors back and asks for a rewrite, up to three times; still failing, the attempt is kept under `guides/.drafts/`, which guide discovery cannot see — so a draft that didn't pass can never end up ticking your notes.

**What it cannot check is whether the guide is right.** Whether the steps work, whether a difficulty rating is fair, whether "easy to miss" is actually true — that's the whole value of a guide and no machine verifies it. Read what it wrote.

## Guide archive

Three directories under `guides/` accumulate past versions, and none of them is visible to
guide discovery (it reads the directory non-recursively, so an archived file can never
re-register itself and can never tick your boxes):

| | what lands there |
|---|---|
| `.backups/` | the previous version, every time a guide is overwritten — a local `.md` copied as-is, a Notion page dumped as raw block JSON |
| `.migrated/` | the local original, left behind when a guide moves to Notion. It is a move, never a delete |
| `.drafts/` | an attempt that failed validation three times |

### Getting one back

On the Dashboard, a row that has archives carries a **备份 N** button at the end, next to
攻略 / 重写 / Notion. It only appears when there is something there, so the count on it is
also the answer to "is there anything to go back to". Clicking it lists that game's archives,
newest first, each offering 查看 / 覆盖 / 删除.

- **查看** renders the content. A Notion backup is block JSON, so it's rendered to plain text
  for reading only — restoring always uses the raw blocks, because the readable rendering
  is lossy and the backup's job is to go back, not to look good.
- **覆盖** puts that version back: a `.md` to its local file, a `.json` to the Notion page it
  came from. The verb is deliberate — it *is* an overwrite of whatever is there now. Which is
  why **it backs up what it is about to replace first**, into the same `.backups/` directory:
  the version you just displaced appears at the top of the same list, one click from coming
  back in turn. The archive you overwrote *from* is copied, not consumed, so it stays too.
- **删除** is permanent, and here it is one file at a time — this panel is about a single
  game, where "all of them" is rarely what you mean. The bulk button lives in Settings.

Both destructive actions take **two clicks**, and the second click's button says what will
happen — 覆盖本地文件 / 整页重写 / 永久删除 — rather than 确定. There is no dialog on top of
the dialog: adjacent rows here often differ only by a timestamp, so moving the question away
from the row it is about is exactly the wrong thing to do. An armed button stays armed until
you click elsewhere, press Escape, or close the panel — it does not time out.

### 设置 → 第 4 步 → 攻略备份

The same files, sorted **biggest first**, with 查看 and 删除 — plus a **全部删除** at the foot
of the list. This view answers a different question — what is taking up space, since every
archive travels inside the backup zip and a Notion page dumps as ~120 KB — so it is sorted by
size rather than by date, and it does not offer 覆盖: that belongs next to the game it is about.

全部删除 takes the same two clicks, and the second one reads 永久删除 N 份 · X MB. Be clear on
what that includes: `.backups/` holds the only remaining copy of every guide version you have
ever overwritten, so this is the undo for every rewrite, not a pile of junk with a size
attached. Only `.drafts/` is genuinely disposable. There is still no time-based sweep —
nothing here deletes itself, and the button never fires without you naming the amount.

It sits **below** the list rather than in the collapsed header on purpose: the header shows a
total and nothing else, so a delete key there would fire against a set you cannot see. And it
deletes exactly the files that were on screen when you armed it, not "whatever is in the
directories" — a rewrite finishing in the background between the two clicks would otherwise
take a backup you never saw along with them.

Its other job is **orphans**: archives whose game is no longer in your library, which
therefore have no row to carry a 备份 button. They are listed first regardless of size. Restoring one is not
offered because it could not work — it would register a guide against a game the Dashboard
does not show — so the way back is to add the game again first.

Two consequences of restoring worth knowing:

- Restoring a `.md` for a game whose guide now lives in Notion **re-registers it as local**.
  The Notion page is not touched, but it stops being the registered guide, and the panel
  says so. Use the row's **Notion** button to send it back.
- Restoring a Notion backup deletes the page's current blocks before writing the old ones.
  That order is deliberate: writing first would leave old and new side by side, and running
  it again would triple them, while deleting first means a failure is fixed by simply
  restoring again. Notion's delete is an archive to its own trash, recoverable for 30 days,
  and the fresh backup is on disk either way. Blocks that cannot be recreated by an append
  (`child_database`, `synced_block`, and similar — they point at other entities) are dropped
  rather than failing the whole restore.

The CLI has `node tracker.js drafts [--clean]` for `.drafts/` only; the other two are
panel-only.

## Reading a guide from the Dashboard

Clicking a game row expands the achievements you haven't unlocked yet. Each card carries **what your own guide says about that achievement**, plus a 📖 next to the achievement's name that opens the Notion page scrolled to that exact checkbox.

The card already prints the name and the official description from Steam, so the guide text has its opening echo of those two stripped — what's left is your notes. Only exact echoes go, and only from the top: a description you paraphrased is your own wording and stays, which is what keeps a *hidden* achievement's condition on screen (Steam gives no description for those, so that line in your guide is the only place it appears). An entry that copied the official text and added nothing shows no guide block at all, rather than repeating what's already above it.

Attribution uses the same reverse lookup `audit` does (`resolveTodoToAchievement`): a verbatim quote of a description that is unique in the game, or a name that maps to exactly one achievement. **It refuses to guess.** An achievement it can't attribute shows **Not written up yet** (「攻略里还没写这条」) and keeps the search link. Do not loosen the matching to fill those blanks — the same function decides which boxes get ticked in your notes, so loosening it here loosens it there.

That refusal is what makes the panel worth reading: every achievement your guide doesn't cover says so on its own card. So the panel doubles as a map of **which achievements your guide still doesn't cover** — something that was previously only reachable by running `guide-lint` across the corpus.

The header above them stays out of it, stating only how many achievements are left (`剩余 8 个成就`) plus, when they disagree, the guide's own language.

Details:

- **Cards in a row line up; the guide text inside them doesn't have to.** The accent rule beside a guide traces the text, so it stops where the text stops — a rule that ran on into blank space would read as "there's more below". Evening out the row is the card's job instead. A guide longer than six lines (sub-steps included) is cut there with a fade and expands on click; clicking again collapses it. One that fits shows no fade and isn't clickable, because there's nothing more to show. While a card is open its row drops back to natural heights, so the others don't become tall empty boxes.
- Sub-steps nested under an achievement come along, indented, with their ticked state.
- **Anything folded away stays folded away here — it is not on the card at all.** A card is built from checkbox blocks, and a fold is a toggle, so a generated guide's spoiler fold (`docs/ai-guide-writing.md`) never reaches this panel. That is the useful direction: the panel lists the achievements you have *not* unlocked and opens unprompted while you browse, so every word of guide text on it is about something still ahead of you. To read what is folded, open the guide itself.
- One Notion read per game, on the first expand, cached for the rest of the page's life.
- **Failure is soft.** An expired token leaves the achievement list exactly as it was and says why in the header — it does not take the panel down.
- Local markdown guides show the text but no jump link: a line number is not an anchor.
- A game with no registered guide is unchanged — search link only. Nothing claims **Not written up yet** (「攻略里还没写这条」) when there is no guide to have written it in.

## Running the sync

```bash
node tracker.js checkbox-sync --dry-run   # read-only preview — do this first
node tracker.js checkbox-sync 3117820     # one game
node tracker.js checkbox-sync             # everything eligible
node tracker.js log 30                    # what it did
```

**Dry-run before any manual full run.** `--dry-run` reads the pages, runs the identical matching, prints exactly which boxes it would tick, and writes nothing — not even to `sync_log`. It earns the wait because the sync only ever **ticks**, never unticks: a wrongly ticked box cannot be undone automatically and has to be fixed by hand.

A game is eligible if it has a registered guide, has an achievement system, and isn't already at 100%. Every run appends to `sync_log`, including skips and failures.

## Automatic ticking

Opening the Dashboard, and the **Sync now** (「立即同步」) button on it, both run a tick pass once the achievement sync finishes. It is deliberately narrower than the manual command:

- **Only games that changed in that run** — ones where your unlocked count went up, ones where the developer added achievements, and guide pages registered for the first time that run. Nothing changed means zero Notion calls, which is the usual case.
- **No sub-step cascade.** Nested boxes under an achievement are only ticked by the manual command, where a dry-run is available first. See the cascade section below for why.
- **Failures are soft.** An expired Notion token shows a notice on the Dashboard; it doesn't fail the achievement sync or take the page down.

Every tick lands in `sync_log` exactly as the manual command's do, so `node tracker.js log 30` is the review path. The Dashboard also shows a notice naming the first few boxes it ticked, and that notice does not auto-dismiss.

Both halves can be turned off in `config.json`:

```json
{ "checkboxSyncOnServe": false, "checkboxSyncOnServeCascade": true }
```

Set the first to `false` to go back to ticking only when you run the command yourself. The second turns the sub-step cascade *on* for the automatic path — off by default on purpose.

One consequence worth knowing: a game that reaches 100% is normally skipped, but a game that reached 100% *in that run* is still visited. Otherwise the achievement that completes a game would never get its box ticked — by the next run the game is already at 100% and would be skipped forever.

## Keeping guide status in step with completion

A Notion guide page's `Status` property is kept aligned with how complete the game is, in both directions:

- Reach 100% → **`Done`**
- Drop below 100% → back to **`Staged`**

```bash
node tracker.js guide-status --dry-run   # what it would change
node tracker.js guide-status             # do it
```

It also runs on the serve path, right after the checkbox tick — that ordering is deliberate, so a game that just completed gets its last boxes ticked *before* the page is marked done. Turn it off with `"guideStatusOnServe": false`.

Dropping below 100% happens when a developer patches in new achievements. It's the one kind of change that occurs without you playing, so a page stuck on `Done` is exactly the case you'd never notice on your own.

**The rules are written over current state, not over the moment of crossing.** That distinction is the whole design. Crossing 100% exists only once, inside a single sync; a run that sees it but can't write to Notion — no token on that machine, expired credentials, an interrupted process — would lose it forever, since every later run just sees the same value on both sides. Checking current state instead means the pass is idempotent, re-runnable, and repairs itself next time.

The two directions are deliberately not equally aggressive:

| | Touches | Leaves alone |
|---|---|---|
| Promote to `Done` | every status except `Done`, `Differed` included | — |
| Demote to `Staged` | only `Done` | `Paused`, `In progress`, `Not started`, `Differed` |

Promotion is safe to be blunt about: reaching 100% is objective. Demotion is narrow on purpose — a sub-100% page you've set to `Paused` is a decision you made, and rewriting it on every Dashboard open would have you and the tool overwriting each other indefinitely.

Notion-kind guides only; local markdown has no status property. A game whose `total` becomes unknown — Steam reporting no achievement system — is never treated as having dropped below 100%.

## Auditing for wrong ticks

`checkbox-sync` only ever ticks, so it can't repair a box that was ticked wrongly. `audit` looks in the opposite direction — for boxes that are ticked while the achievement is still locked:

```bash
node tracker.js audit            # everything
node tracker.js audit 570780     # one game
```

Read-only; it never writes, so there's no `--dry-run`. It only examines games below 100%, since every box in a fully-completed game is legitimately ticked.

To decide *which* achievement a given checkbox refers to, it needs an unambiguous handle, and it will only use one of two:

1. the achievement's **full description**, quoted in the checkbox text, when that description is unique in the game;
2. the achievement's **name**, when that name maps to exactly one achievement.

One box can satisfy the first handle for several achievements at once, because a tiered family writes the easier tier's description inside the harder one's — Factorio's `建造出内燃机车。` sits inside `在游戏90分钟内建造出内燃机车。`. The **longest** quoted description is the one taken, since a proper substring of it says less about the same sentence; two different achievements quoted at the same length is a genuine tie and resolves to nothing. A description holding no characters at all — Steam ships a few that are a single space — is not a handle in the first place, and an achievement carrying one is reached only by its name.

If neither applies, the box is counted as undetermined and reported as such — never guessed. That's why output distinguishes "confirmed wrong" from "couldn't tell": on a 310-game library, 1,175 ticked boxes resolved cleanly and 65 didn't, and claiming the latter were fine would have been a lie. Writing guides so they quote the official description verbatim is what keeps that second number small.

## How matching works, and why it's strict

An unlocked achievement is matched to a checkbox by **exact equality** against candidate segments extracted from the checkbox text. Never substring, never prefix.

Candidates are split out by line break, by the first colon or dash, and from the `中文名(English Name)` pattern — plus the whole line. The achievement's Chinese *or* English name must equal one of those candidates exactly.

This strictness is deliberate and was arrived at the hard way. Loose matching produced two separate rounds of wrong ticks:

1. an achievement name appearing inside an unrelated achievement's *description*, and
2. a short achievement name being a strict *prefix* of a different, harder achievement — which mis-ticked the harder one once the short one's own box was already checked.

There's a third case exact matching can't solve on its own: some games contain **two different achievements with identical names**. If only one is unlocked, names alone can't say which checkbox belongs to it. If both are unlocked, any assignment is correct and it proceeds normally.

A name is disqualified individually, not the achievement as a whole. Most collisions are localization slips where only one language is affected — Plague Inc ships two achievements called 生化武器大师 whose English names are `Nano-Virus Master` and `Bioweapon Master` — so if the other language's name is unique, matching still uses it. The colliding name itself is never used either way.

**The fix for that is in how you write the guide, not in the code.** If a checkbox quotes the achievement's official description verbatim, and that description is unique in the game, the box is unambiguously about that achievement — so the sync can tick it correctly even though the names collide. That's why the recommended shape is:

```
- [ ] **成就名**
      official description, copied verbatim
      your own notes and tips
```

The name (on its own line, or followed by a colon or dash) is what lets the box be ticked; the verbatim description is what lets it be *verified*, and what rescues same-name pairs. Paraphrasing the description costs you both. Do **not** disambiguate by adding a suffix to the name (`妙手空空·通关100次版`) — that stops the name matching exactly, so neither box can ever be ticked.

The rule throughout: **a missed checkbox is better than a wrong one.** If you tighten or loosen any of this, run `node --test` — `test/matching.test.js` pins all three failure modes.

## When something doesn't get ticked

Roughly in order of likelihood:

- The achievement isn't actually unlocked on Steam. Check the Dashboard's per-game detail.
- The guide's wording doesn't match the achievement name closely enough to produce an exact candidate. Matching is intentionally unforgiving here; adjust the checkbox text.
- The game has two identically-named achievements — see above. `node tracker.js log` will say so explicitly.
- The page has no checkbox blocks at all (a pure walkthrough, or an embedded database using a "Done" property instead of checkboxes). Databases aren't supported; that needs different logic.
- The achievement detail hasn't been synced yet, so the tool doesn't know the achievement's names: `node tracker.js sync --schema`.
