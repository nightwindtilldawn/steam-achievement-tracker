/**
 * The terminal-only advice was not lost
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Error messages in lib/ now say only **what happened**, because the same sentence appears
 * verbatim in the Dashboard's floater, where the user (especially in the packaged build) has
 * no terminal and should not be asked to edit config.json.
 *
 * But advice like "add --provider X" or "raise ai.maxAchievements" is the most useful thing
 * there is for a terminal user, and should not evaporate to accommodate the other surface.
 * It moved into `tracker.js`'s `CLI_HINTS`, keyed by the error's `code`. **This file exists
 * because of that move**: three tests used to pin those sentences inside the message bodies,
 * and after the change those three naturally stopped applying — without pinning them again in
 * the new place, a guarantee would have been silently deleted.
 *
 * It checks by source text, the same approach as `html-smoke.test.js` /
 * `SKILL_RULE_DISPOSITION` — `tracker.js` is the CLI entry point and runs a command on
 * import, so the constants cannot simply be imported out.
