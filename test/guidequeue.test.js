/**
 * Queueing for guide generation
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * This file guards two things: **a task silently disappearing** and **the queue wedging**.
 *
 * Generating one guide takes 2–4 minutes, so "queue three and go do something else" is real
 * usage. And every failure on this path is silent: a task quietly dropped, the queue never
 * advancing again after some failure, the same game queued twice and therefore written twice —
 * not one of them raises an error, they merely leave someone coming back twenty minutes later
 * to find the work not done.
 *
 * The original behaviour was to **refuse** the second one (`{error: '已经有一个攻略在生成了'}`),
 * and that error was overwritten three seconds later by the poll with the name of the game
 * currently running — from the user's position, "clicking did nothing".
