/**
 * Structural smoke tests for Dashboard.html / Setup.html
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * ## What it is, and what it is not
 *
 * **This is not a behaviour test.** The project has zero dependencies (see CLAUDE.md), with no
 * jsdom and no Playwright, so no real DOM runs here — clicks, focus and CSS cascade cannot be
 * verified at all, and that part still depends on a person looking at a browser.
 * **Do not read a green run of this file as "the interface is fine".**
 *
 * What it verifies is **referential integrity**: does the element the JS points at exist, does
 * what a selector points at exist, does the script parse. That sounds shallow, but it is exactly
 * the real failure mode of these two files — a page is one big string, and renaming or deleting
 * an element **makes nothing report anything**, it merely becomes null at runtime, silently, or
 * quietly stops a CSS rule from matching anything.
 *
 * These checks were written from **pits actually fallen into**, not made up as a list:
 *
 * - After `<details>` became `<section>`, the `details ol code` and `.hint a` rules stopped
 *   matching — inline code fell back to the default monospace and links in the notes turned dark
 *   blue, nearly invisible on a dark ground, and **nothing reported anything**. (Check: a type
 *   selector in the CSS has to still have a corresponding tag)
 * - After the whole `#newAchSection` block was deleted, a leftover `getElementById` returned null.
 *   (Check: every id the JS references has to exist)
 * - A hidden `required` control makes the browser **refuse to submit silently**, logging
 *   "not focusable" in the console, and presenting as "pressing save does nothing".
 *   (Check: no required inside the stepped form)
 * - The same failure came back through `type="number"`'s own "bad input" state (typing a lone
 *   "-" is enough) after `required` and then `min`/`max`/`step` had each been removed from the
 *   offending control individually — three attributes, one failure mode. (Check: the form
 *   carries `novalidate`, so no fourth attribute can reopen it)
 * - `classList.toggle(name, undefined)` **flips rather than clears**, so with a field missing from
 *   the state object the sync line in the topbar blinks every 3 seconds and never stops.
 *   (Check: the second argument has to be booleanised)

/**
 * The `hidden` attribute has to really hide — both pages need that global rule
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The browser's own `[hidden] { display: none }` comes from the **user-agent stylesheet**, and any
 * `display:` in the author stylesheet outranks it. So one unrelated layout rule can quietly turn
 * an element's `hidden` into decoration: the JS sets `.hidden = true` as usual, the element shows
 * as usual, and **nothing reports anything**.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. A scan on 2026-08-14 found three already caught across the two pages:
 *   · `.gallery { display: grid }`  → after the Dashboard switches back to the table view, the
 *     grid content stays below the table (`render` returns early in table mode and never repaints
 *     #gallery, so the old content hangs there)
 *   · `.steps { display: flex }`         → the step bar on the setup page
 *   · `.step-actions { display: flex }`  → the button row on the setup page, all three showing at once
 *
 * The page **already** carried a `.step[hidden] { display: none }` at the time — so the pit was
 * known, and patching it one element at a time is whack-a-mole: the next rule carrying `display`
 * opens a new hole, equally silently.
 * So it became one global rule, making this class structurally impossible. The `!important` is
 * required, because what it has to outrank is exactly "some display someone writes later".
 *
 * What is pinned here is **the rule itself**, not a few elements — elements come and go, and while
 * the rule is there this class cannot come back.

 * page — and an undefined CSS variable raises no error, it makes the whole declaration invalid and
 * the colour quietly falls back to the inherited value.
 *
